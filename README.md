# Classifaction

## This is a repository for finding the difference between `real rule` and `the rule that classifier finds`.

* The dataset I designed is in data.csv.  
* The rules I used are :  
	* Age < 30 && Has_Kids = 1 && Income < 35000 & Contract_Length < 20 --> Label = 1    

* Two classifiers are used in this project: DecisionTreeClassifier and XGBClassifier  
	* The tree of DecisionTreeClassifier can see in `./decision_tree.png`  
	* The tree of XGBClassifier can see in `./xgb_tree`
